;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package allows Emacs to use any of the external address book
;; access tools that already work with the Mutt MUA external query
;; mechanism.  http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-4.html#query
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; (require 'lbdb-complete)
;;
;; Bind `lbdb-complete' to a key binding of your choice.
;; It will expand the text before point into an email address from
;; your external address book.

(require 'lbdb)
